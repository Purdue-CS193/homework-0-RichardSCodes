# Richard Su's First CS193 Homework
- Using the console makes me feel powerful
- In the past one of my barriers to entry in CS was not knowing much about IDEs or consoles or Git and not knowing what tools to know and when and how, so I'm excited to learn about that
- The teaching is engaging with the right amount of humor!
- Making my first github page :)
